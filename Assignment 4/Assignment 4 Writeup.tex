    \section{Short answer problems}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textit{What is the relation between image classification and object detection?
        Please give two concrete exampleson how they are related (e.g., one is applied to solve another)?}
        % TODO: Answer

        \item \textit{Please compare semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and object detection.
        Describe the similarities and differences.}
        % TODO: Answer

        \item \textit{Describe at least two plausible neural network designs for the task of semantic segmentations.}
        % TODO: Answer

        \item \textit{What are the applications of generative models in solving core computer vision tasks.}
        % TODO: Answer

        \item \textit{Discuss the differences between convolution neural networks and deconvolution neural networks.}

    \end{enumerate}


    \section{Image Classification}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Compare the performance between K-Nearest Neighbor classifier and Adaptive Boosting classifier;}
        % TODO: Answer

        \item \textit{Analyze the performance of these two methods when varying the size of the training set
        and the size of the testing set;}
        % TODO: Answer

        \item \textit{Perform cross-validation to study the hyper-parameters of each method;}
